Flower Image Classification with CNNs

This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify flower images. To combat overfitting, we utilize data augmentation and dropout layers, resulting in a test set accuracy boost from 66.99% to 73.74%. Additionally, we leverage transfer learning with a pre-trained model from Google's TensorFlow Hub, achieving an impressive 86.7% accuracy on test data. The project structure includes data, model, and notebook directories, alongside a requirements file. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, and explore the Jupyter notebooks for insights. Experiment with hyperparameters and architectures to further improve performance. This project serves as a valuable resource for image classification enthusiasts, showcasing the effectiveness of CNNs and transfer learning in real-world applications.
